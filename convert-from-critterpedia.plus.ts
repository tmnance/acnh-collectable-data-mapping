A pugilist through and through, this brightly hued fellow packs a punch unparalleled on land or sea. Not only are its forelimbs shaped like clubs and scythes, its arms are naturally spring-loaded too! Thus the mantis shrimp\'s high-speed blows crack open crabs and oyster shells with ease. And should you grab it with your hands, you might discover why it\'s called \\"the thumb splitter\\" too!","image-uri":"https://acnhcdn.com/latest/BookDiveFishIcon/DiveFishSyakoCropped.png","icon-uri":"https://acnhcdn.com/latest/MenuIcon/Shako.png","shadow":"Small","speed":"Medium"},{"id":33,"filename":"spiny_lobster","names":{"EUde":"Languste","EUen":"spiny lobster","EUit":"aragosta mediterranea","EUnl":"langoest","EUru":"\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0438\u0439 \u043b\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442","EUfr":"langouste","EUes":"langosta espinosa","USen":"spiny lobster","USfr":"langouste","USes":"langosta espinosa","JPja":"\u30a4\u30bb\u30a8\u30d3","KRko":"\ub2ed\uc0c8\uc6b0","TWzh":"\u4f0a\u52e2\u9f8d\u8766","CNzh":"\u4f0a\u52bf\u9f99\u867e"},"availability":{"isAllYear":false,"isAllDay":false,"time":[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1],"month-northern":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1],"month-southern":[0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]},"price":5000,"rarity":"Uncommon","catch-phrase":"I got a spiny lobster!
